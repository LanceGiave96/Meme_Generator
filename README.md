# Meme Generator App​! 👻​🤠​🤩​🤣​

This web project is made by using React and Vite.js configuration with Rollup for bundle the JS code.
The meme images are taken by the free API [get_memes](https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes/) ​💯​👨‍💻​.
Once the image is taken (randomically for now), it's possible to add up to 4 free text boxes; 
furthermore, the boxes can be dragged and dropped in the image rendered! 😎​😲​
